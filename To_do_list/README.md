## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

This being a pretty simple project primarily taking advantage while loops to help keep the program running. I started the program off by intitalizing the list I would be adding the tasks too. Once intialized I started with the fucntions like checking the list and adding the list, along with subtacring from the list. The programs relys primarily on if statemnts and while loops.
