# My Awesome Project
This is a discord bot that I made using the nextcord module. The bot was made to whold stats of my schools Esports team. Stats include K/D, W/L, and the GTCC schedule. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python
The discord bot was made with the purpose of storing data into files and being able to pull out the same data and use it to calculate the stats of the team. The program primarily focuses on appending data and retrieving it. The program uses nextcords modules to really control the progam. The user is able to update the stats manually through the disocrd both and have it store into the file.


## Optimizations
Although the discord bot does get the job done. I feel as if takingadvantage of an sql server would let me store the data easier.
